   /* Write a Java program that prints the Fibonacci series up to a
    specified number of terms. The Fibonacci series starts with
    two initial terms (0 and 1) and each subsequent term is the sum
    of the two preceding ones. The program should ask the user to
    enter the number of terms they want to print and then display
    the Fibonacci series accordingly.*/
