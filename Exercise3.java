public class Exercise3 {

    /*Ceate a Java program that showcases the implementation of interfaces. Specifically, you will define two interfaces, `Drawable` and `Resizable`, and create a class named `Rectangle` that implements both interfaces. The `Rectangle` class should represent a geometric rectangle and provide methods for drawing the rectangle and resizing it.

            1. Interfaces:
            - Define the `Drawable` interface with a single method: `void draw()`. This method should be responsible for displaying a message indicating the drawing of the rectangle.
- Define the `Resizable` interface with a single method: `void resize(int width, int height)`. This method should enable the resizing of the rectangle to the specified width and height.

2. Rectangle Class:
            - Create a class called `Rectangle` that implements both `Drawable` and `Resizable` interfaces.
- Include the following attributes within the `Rectangle` class:
            - `int width`: Denotes the width of the rectangle.
            - `int height`: Denotes the height of the rectangle.

            3. Method Implementations:
            - In the `Rectangle` class, provide concrete implementations for the `draw` and `resize` methods:
            - The `draw` method should print a message indicating that the rectangle is being drawn, along with its current width and height.
            - The `resize` method should allow the rectangle to be resized by updating its width and height. It should also print a message indicating the new dimensions.

4. Main Class:
            - In the `Main` class, create an instance of the `Rectangle` class, specifying an initial width and height.
            - Demonstrate the functionality by performing the following actions:
            - Call the `draw` method to show the rectangle being drawn with its initial dimensions.
- Call the `resize` method to demonstrate resizing the rectangle to different dimensions.

    Ensure that your program clearly illustrates the proper implementation of interfaces, allowing the `Rectangle` class to inherit and implement the behavior
            specified by the `Drawable` and `Resizable` interfaces.*/
